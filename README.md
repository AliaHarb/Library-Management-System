The **Library Management System** is a C# console or web-based application designed to manage the operations of a library efficiently. It allows users to perform various tasks such as adding 
books, borrowing and returning books, tracking due dates, and managing library members.

- As a **user** , I want to have a **library card** so that I can borrow **books** from the **library**
- As a **librarian , I** want to add new **books** to the **library's** collection so that they can be available for borrowing
- As a **librarian , I** want to remove **books** from the **library's** collection so that they can keep the collection up-to-date
- As a **librarian , I** want to display a list of all the **books** in the **library's** collection so that **users** can easily find books they are interested in
